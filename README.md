# Knapsack-Problem-Cpp
Uses a genetic algorithm to solve the knapsack problem in cpp.

What is the knapsack problem? We have a knapsack, and we want to fill it with the most valuable items. The weight is constrained. In our case 15kg.
We have the following items:
* 375 € and 3,75 kg
* 300 € and 2,5 kg
* 100 € and 2,0 kg
* 225 € and 3,0 kg
* 50 € and 1,0 kg
* 125 € and 1,75 kg
* 75 € and 0,75 kg
* 275 € and 3,0 kg
* 150 € and 2,5 kg
* 50 € and 2,25 kg

The best genom is 0011101011 with a fitness / value of 1375 €.

Further possible improvements: 
* Implement saving / loading of genoms. With more sophisticated problems the generation of good genoms could take quite a time. So it would be nice to be able to save and load good genoms.
